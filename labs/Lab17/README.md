## Array Helpers (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- We need a method called allLess that accepts two arrays of integers and returns true if each element in the first array is less than the element at the same index in the second array; otherwise return false. If the arrays are not the same length, the method should return false.
- We need a method called swapPairs that accepts an array of integers and swaps the elements at adjacent indexes. That is, elements 0 and 1 are swapped, elements 2 and 3 are swapped, and so on. If the array has an odd length, the final element should be left unmodified.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know what methods we need to create.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to properly use arrays.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need an algorithm to check whether the lengths of two arrays aren't equal.
- We need an algorithm to go through every index of each array and check whether one is greater than the other.
- We need an algorthm to go through every 2 elements of an array and swap them.

How will you test each method?

- Use the test program.
