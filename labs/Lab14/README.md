# CSC116: Lab 14 Journal - More Input Files

Names: Selena Chen & Armaan Syed

## Flip Lines (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning 

- Reverse lines by adding each line (followed by a new line character) to the beginning of a String variable (that was originally empty).

## Flip Lines Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

- Our code addressed all of the requirements.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

- We learned how to use line-based testing.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

- We learned how to reverse the order of lines and words.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- 45 min

## Weather Reporter

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- We need a program called WeatherReporter that prompts the user for an input file name and reads the given file.
- We need the program to output to the console the date, low temperature, high temperature, and whether or not it'll rain and snow.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know the format of the files.
- We know what our program should be called and what the method within it should be called.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to process text files

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need an algorithm to read from the user-inputted file.
- We need an algorithm to print out the data from the file to the console.
