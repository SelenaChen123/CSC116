## RationalNumber (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- This program represents a fraction with an integer numerator and denominator with methods to get the denominator, get the numerator, convert to String, check whether one number equals another, and perform operations

* What is already known about the problem?

- We know what the program should be called and what methods are needed.

* What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to create and use constructors.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need algorithms to to create a RationalNumber object, get the denominator, get the numerator, convert to String, check whether one number equals another, add numbers, subtract numbers, multiply numbers, and divide numbers.

How will you test each method?

- Using the white box test program.

## RationalNumber (***After*** writing code)
