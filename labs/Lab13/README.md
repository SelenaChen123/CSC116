# CSC116: Lab 13 Journal - Input Files

Names: Selena Chen & Armaan Syed

## Process File (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- We need to prompt the user for a filename and reprompt is it doesn't exist.
- We need to print the max, min, sum, count, and average of just the integers in the file.
- We need to create test files that contain integers, doubles, and Strings.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know what we have to name the program.
- We know that we will need to create multiple tets files with different data types.
- We know how to find the max, min, sum, count, and average of integers.


What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to input files and read from them.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need an algorithm to prompt user for a filename and check to see if it exists.
- We need an algorithm to reprompt the user if the filename previously given doesn't exist.
- We need a loop to continue reading in integers from the file.
- We need algorithms to find the max, min, sum, count, and average of the integers in the file.
