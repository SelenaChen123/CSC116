## SeriesOfNumbers Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Program called SeriesOfNumbers
- Contain a for loop
- Should not use the multiplication operator

What is already known about the problem?

- The output 
- The pattern (the count squared, but we have to figure out a different pattern to create the program without the multiplication operator)

What questions do you have about the problem?

- How are we going to create this program without the use of the multiplication operator?

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use and create a for loop

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- Create a variable called number that is set to 0.
- Create a for loop for the odd integer values that are added to each preceding number value
- Print the updated number value inside the for loop
- Add print line statement at the end

### Sharing and Extending

- The group we shared with had the same idea of adding odd integer values to each preceding number value using a for loop

### Final Planning

After sharing ideas, what changes would you make to enhance your solution plan?

- Our solution is already concise, and effectively uses the for loop to create the series of numbers.  The changes we have to make involve style. We have to create more variables in order to eliminate magic numbers.

## SeriesOfNumbers Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

- Our code fulfilled all of the requirements of this exercise.  It compiled and ran correctly.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

- We used the knowledge of for loops to effectively create a program that printed the expected output.  We learned how to set up a for loop (include what to put inside the argument) and how to create statements that would run inside the for loop.  We also applied the concept of a counter, to ensure that this loop would not run forever.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise?

- We were confused at first on how we would create this program without the multiplication operator.  We later realized looking at the adjacent numbers and determining the pattern between them was crucial to create this program, and it helped broaden our thinking in different ways to achieve the same output.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- 50 minutes
