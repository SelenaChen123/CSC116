# Exam Score Processor: Program Scenario

Dr. Schmidt is using an array to store the exam scores for students in your section of CSC 116. A student’s ID is the index of the array, such that the first student is index/student ID 0, the second student is index/student ID 1, and so on. Please design a program to help Dr. Schmidt complete the following tasks:

1. Find the student with the largest ID who received a given score, such as 85.
2. Find the highest score and the lowest score of the exam. Remember that you do not want to modify the array since the indexes relate to student IDs.
3. CSC 116 uses a ten point scale for A/B/C/D grades (see syllabus). Count the number of students who received a given grade, such as B.
