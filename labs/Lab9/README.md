## Palindrome Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Prompt user to enter one or more words and prints whether the string is a palindrome or not

What is already known about the problem?

- We need a Palindrome class
- We need an isPalindrome method
- We know what a palindrome is

What questions do you have about the problem?

- What string and character methods would we need for this program?

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use the string and character methods
- How to process text
- How to use for loops and conditionals

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- Convert the user-inputted string to lowercase.
- Compare every character of the string with the corresponding letter at the other end of the string.
- If all characters match with the corresponding letter at the other end of the string, then the string is a palindrome.

### Sharing and Extending
To help you consider alternative perspectives, share and discuss your initial analysis and solution plan with another group.

- Shared with the group behind us.

### Final Planning
After sharing ideas, what changes would you make to enhance your solution plan?

- None

## Palindrome Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

- Our code addressed all of the requirements.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

- We used the string and char methods to process text.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

- How to check whether or not a string is a palindrome.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- 15 minutes

## Perfect Number Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- We need a perfectNumbers method that accepts an integer maximum and returns a String containing all perfect numbers up to and including that maximum.
- If a non-positive number is given to perfectNumbers, an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know how to check whether a number is perfect or not.
- We know how to check for the factors of a number.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- We need to know how to throw exceptions.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- Create a method called isPerfectNumber that checks whether or not the sum of the factors of a number (other than the number itself) is equal to the actual number.
- Create a method called perfectNumbers where we check for all of the perfect numbers up to a user-inputted integer.

## Perfect Number Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

- Our code addressed all requirements

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

- We created an exception to check for the pre condition of having only a positive integers

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

- We learned what a perfect number was, and how to check for perfect numbers from 0 to a user-inputted integer.

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- 30 min
