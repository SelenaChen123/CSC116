# CSC116: Lab 11 Journal - while Loop

Names: Selena Chen and Armaan Syed

## All Digits Odd? Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Write a program that takes an integer and returns whether every digit of the integer is odd.
- We need a method called lastDigit and a method called withoutLastDigit.
- We need the main method to prompt the user for an integer and print whether the integer consists of odd digits or not.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know how to return the last digit of an integer.
- We know how to return everything but the last digit of an integer.
- We need a method called lastDigit and a method called withoutLastDigit.
- We need a program called AllDigitsOdd.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- How to construct a while loop that fits the requirements of the problem.

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use a while loop.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need an algorithm to return the last digit of an integer by taking the integer modulus 10.
- We need an algorithm to return everything but the last digit of an integer by taking the integer divided bt 10.
- We need to use conditionals and while loops to check every digit of the integer.
