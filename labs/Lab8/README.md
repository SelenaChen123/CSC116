# CSC116: Lab 08 Journal - if/else Statements

Names: Ayushi Verma and Selena Chen

## Even or Odd? Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

 - To determine whether a user-inputted an even or odd integer. 

What is already known about the problem?

- We know it should return "even" string if even, and "odd" string if odd.
- We know what even and odd numbers are
- We know we have to create an evenOdd method

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use conditionals

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- Prompt the user to type in an integer.  Then store that integer as a variable.  Next, use an if statement to print even if the remainder of the user-inputted variable divided by 2 equals 0, and odd if not.


## Even or Odd? Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise?

- Our code addressed all of the requirements

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise?

- We used if statements to determine whether an integer was even or odd

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

- Learned that we could return Strings
- How to effectively use Scanner and conditionals

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- 40 min

## Triangle Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

 - We need to create an isValidTriangle method to see if the user-inputted side lengths create an actual triangle
- We need to create a getTriangleType method to determine whether the triangle is equilateral, scalene, isosceles, or not valid triangle

What is already known about the problem?

- We know how to determine whether a triangle is valid or not
- We know how to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, scalene, or isosceles.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use conditionals

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need an algorithm to check whether one sideâ€™s length is longer than the sum of the other two or a side length is negative to determine if the triangle is invalid.  Next, we create another algorithm to compare the three side lengths to see if two are equal or none are equal to determine triangle type.

## Triangle Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

- Our code addressed all parts of the exercise

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

- We applied the conditionals to determine the kind of triangle and whether or not the triangle was valid

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

- We learned that how to test whether a triangle is valid or not and how to apply conditionals to programs

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- One hour
