# CSC116: Lab 21 Journal -  Interacting Classes

Names: Selena Chen & Ayushi Verma

## Bakery (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Create classes called bread, SandwichFilling, and Sandwich.
- In the Bread class, create private data fields for the bread type and calories per type, create a constructor to take parameters for that field, create getter methods, and create toString and equals methods.
- In the SandwichFilling class, create private fields for the filling type and calories in a serving, create a constructor to take parameters for that field, create getter methods, and create toString and equals methods.
- In the Sandwich class, include a private Bread field and a private SandwichFilling field, create Sandwich constructors with different parameters, create a totalCalories method, and create toString and equals methods.

What is already known about the problem?

- What the classes and methods should be called and what they should do.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- What heuristics is and how classes interact.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need algorithms to create constructors, get parameters, get calories, get fillings, convert to string, and check whether or not two objects are equal.

How will you test each method?

- Using the white box test programs.
