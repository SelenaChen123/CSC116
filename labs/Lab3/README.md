# CSC116: Lab 03 Journal - Data and Variables

Names: Selena Chen, Ayushi Verma

## Eggs.java Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?
- Include a variable for the number of eggs in an order
- Display amount owed with a full explanation
- Number of eggs should be 38

What is already known about the problem?
  - $3.25 per dozen eggs
  - $0.45 per loose egg
What questions do you have about the problem?
  - None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?
- Different primitive data types
- Declaring, assigning, and using variables
- Evaluating expressions

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- 38 divided by 12 will be the number of dozens.
- The remainder of 38 divided by 12 will be the number of loose eggs.
- The number of dozens multiplied by $3.25 will be the otal cost of the dozens.
- The number of loose eggs multiplied by $0.45 will be the total cost of the loose eggs.
- Adding the two total costs will give the overall total cost.
- "You ordered __ eggs. That's __ dozen eggs at $3.25 per dozen and __ loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of __." should be printed to the console at the end.

### Sharing and Extending
To help you consider alternative perspectives, share and discuss your initial analysis and solution plan with another group that you will be paired with.

- Shared with Group 13.
- They had similar algorithms.

### Final Planning
After sharing ideas, what changes would you make to enhance your solution plan?

- None

## Eggs.java Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 
- Our code met all of the requirements.

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 
- We looked at our algorithm to see what variables we needed and then applied what we learned about declaring, assigning, and using variables to our program.
- We figured out what expressions we needed in order to determine the costs.

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 
- What magic numbers were
- How to add strings of different data types

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.
- 30 min
