# CSC116: Lab 15 Journal - Output Files

Names: Selena Chen & Armaan Syed

## Collapse Spaces (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- We need a method called collapsedSpaces and a program called Collapse. The method should read the contents of the file and output it with all its tokens separated by single spaces, collapsing any sequences of multiple spaces into single spaces. The main method should prompt the user for input and output filenames, then pass the appropriate Scanner and PrintStream to collapseSpaces method.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know what methods we need, how to read from the console and files, and how to print to files.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to output to a file using a PrintStream.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need algorithms to read from the console, read from the file, output to a file, and collapse the spaces. 

## Collapse Spaces Reflection (***After*** writing code)

How well did your code address the requirements of this exercise? 

- Very well. 

How did you apply the pre-lab concepts in this exercise? 

- We used PrintStream. 

What are some new insights that you learned from this exercise? 

- We learned how to ouput to a file. 

Estimate how much time (minutes) you spent on this exercise.

- 30 min
