## Decimal to Binary Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Create a program called DecimalToBinary that converts a decimal int into a binary string.
- We need a method called convertToBinary.
- We need the user to input a decimal integer.
- We need to throw an exception if the integer is negative.
- We need a main method that includes an indefinite loop that continues to prompt the user until they type -1 to quit
- We need a main method that include checks for invalid input and reprompts the user

What is already known about the problem?

- We need a main method that prompts the user for input
- We need a convertToBinary method that converts a decimal integer into binary string
- We know how to convert decimal to binary

What questions do you have about the problem?

- How to create the convertToBinary method

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use while and do-while loops

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need an algorithm to prompt the user for input and store that input as an integer parameter
- We need to use modulus division and regular division to convert the decimal integer into a binary string

## Decimal to Binary Reflection (***After*** writing code)
