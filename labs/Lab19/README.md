## Name (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- We need a class called Name that represents a person's name.
- The class should have fields representing the personâ€™s first name (String), last name (String), and middle initial (char).
- The Name class needs the methods setFirstName, setLastName, setMiddle, getFirstName, getMiddleInitial, getLastName, getNormalOrder, getReverseOrder, getUnityID, getInitials, length, toString, and equals.
- We need a NameClient program that creates an array of 5 Names, reads in names from the console, and prints the array name by name (in normal order) such that each full name is on its own line.

What is already known about the problem?

- We know what methods are needed and what classes are needed.
- We know how to create classes and methods.

What questions do you have about the problem?

- None

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use object-oriented programming.

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- We need algorithms to get and set the components of the name.
- We need an algorithm to get the normal order and the reverse order of the name just by printing strings.
- We need an algorithm get the unity ID by using the substring method.
- We need an algorithm to get the initials by using the substring method again.
- We need an algorithm to get the length of the name by using the length method.
- We need an algorithm to check whether two names were equal by using boilerplate code from pre-labs.

How will you test each method?

- Using the white box test program.
