## Reverse Input from User Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Prompt user to enter his or her full name
- Print the name in reverse order

What is already known about the problem?

- Expected output
- Starter code and given method header/description

What questions do you have about the problem?

- How to prompt the user for input, then print the reverse

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to use the Scanner
- How to utilize Strings

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- Import the Scanner
- Print a prompt asking for the user's full name
- Ask the user for input
- Print the input in reverse order

### Sharing and Extending

## Coconuts Planning (***Before*** writing code)

### Initial Planning - Problem Analysis

What are the requirements of this problem?

- Write a program that accepts a non-negative integer, calculates the initial number of coconuts and displays how many coconuts each sailor takes, as well as how many they share in the morning
- Must use a for loop inside the printResults method

What is already known about the problem?

- Equation of the solution
- Expected output

What questions do you have about the problem?

- How to create equations for the number of coconuts each sailor takes
- How to utilize a for loop for this problem

What knowledge concepts from pre-lab would help you solve this problem?

- How to utilize the Scanner

### Initial Planning - Solution Plan

What algorithms will be needed to address the problem? Describe the algorithms using English statements or sentences. You should not write out Java code yet.

- Import the Scanner
- Print a prompt asking the user for a non-negative integer a
- Print the initial number of coconuts
- Use a for loop to calculate and print the number of coconuts divided by 5, then minus 1 for each of the 5 sailors
- Calculate and print the remaining number of coconuts, how many each sailor gets of the remaining, and the number of coconuts the monkey gets
